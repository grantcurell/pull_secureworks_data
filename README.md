This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up and run the pull_secureworks_api_data.py script to download threat intelligence data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Installing Python on Windows

1. Visit the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2. Click on 'Downloads' and select the Windows version.
3. Download the executable installer.
4. Run the downloaded file and follow the installation prompts. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

## Downloading the Script

1. Go to the GitHub repository at https://github.com/grantcurell/pull_secureworks_data.
2. Find the green button labeled 'Code' and click on it.
3. Click 'Download ZIP'.
4. Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to your desired location.

## Getting SecureWorks Credentials

### Manually Create Credentials

To create your client credentials manually, follow the steps below:

### Find Tenant ID on Subscriptions Page

To find your tenant ID, select **Tenant Settings** from the left-hand side navigation of XDR and choose **Subscriptions**.

#### Step 1
Log in to Taegisâ„¢ XDR in Chrome.

#### Step 2
Open the Chrome Developer Tools by right clicking on a web page and selecting inspect.

#### Step 3

Go to the Console tab and enter the following:
```javascript
copy(localStorage.access_token)
```

At this point you have your access token in the copy clipboard. You now need to place your tenant ID and access token in the script.

**WARNING** The access token will only be valid as long as your session lasts with the SecureWorks website and then it will die.

## Editing the Script

1. Navigate to the extracted folder and locate the [`pull_secureworks_api_data.py`](./pull_secureworks_api_data.py) file.
2. Open the file and choose to open with your native text editor (such as Notepad).

## Updating Your Access Token and Tenant ID

Before running the script, update it with your `ACCESS_TOKEN` and `TENANT_ID`.

Within the text editor, locate the following lines:

```python
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
TENANT_ID = 'YOUR_TENANT_ID'
```

## What the Script Does

When the script runs, it will:
- Connect to the SecureWorks service using the access token and tenant ID you provided.
- Download all available SecureWorks data into the folder downloads in the current directory

Don't forget you have to replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `YOUR_TENANT_ID` with valid credentials and save the changes to the script before running it.
